# Absolute Platform - Development History

## Project Overview
**Platform Name**: Absolute  
**Created**: October 6, 2025  
**Reference Platform**: Fs_Image_Collection  
**Developer**: Claude Code Assistant  

## Project Requirements
The client requested a new platform named "Absolute" with the following specifications:
1. Use `/Users/lalithprakash/Projects/Haidata_Projects/Fs_Image_Collection` as reference
2. Implement 4 user roles:
   - Admin
   - QC User
   - Upload User
   - Supervisor
3. Login page with Google registration option
4. Frontend on port 3002, Backend on port 5003
